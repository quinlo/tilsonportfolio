# BroadwayHD

BroadwayHD is an online streaming service extending the reach of Broadway and Broadway caliber shows to anyone, anywhere.  Tilson designed, developed, and continues to maintain BroadwayHDâ€™s subscription-based web application, delivering a wide variety of on-demand theatre productions as well as supporting frequent live streams from renowned theatres across the U.S.

A substantial user interface redesign was undertaken in late 2017 and launched just before the beginning of 2018.  The primary goals of the redesign were to provide clearer navigation, a shorter path to the BroadwayHD library of content, a modern user experience for content delivery, and to streamline the purchase-path flow for new users, increasing conversion rates and reducing bounce rates.  These goals were met through a variety of various sub-tasks undertaken by the developers at Tilson.

## Updated Style Guide and Accompanying Streamlined Code

The first major task was to work hand-in-hand with BroadwayHD's design team to come up with a new color palette, design scheme, and style-guide for the new site.  We wanted a modern, minimalistic style that allowed for the user to focus on the content of the platform.  The re-branding effort resulted in a new logo, brighter colors, and modern platform styling (buttons, fonts, layout, sitemap).

Based on the new style-guide, Tilson revamped the web-app's architecture to include some updated style best-practices including compilation, concatenation, and minification of syntactically awesome stylesheets (better known as SASS) to better organize and maintain BroadwayHD's styles throughout the site.

## Revamped Layouts

The next step in the redesign phase was to alter the presentation layer of the existing application to match the new mocked-up layout. Inspired by google's material design specifications, Tilson utilized a framework called materialize to craft the global stylesheets to work with the new style-guide and layout mockups.

Each view of the site was considered and mocked up with a bare-bones prototype to illustrate where content should reside depending on the device size and browser width.  While user interaction and animation were not present in these mockups, the layouts were crafted and the scaffolding erected with basic user interaction in mind (i.e. sliders, dropdowns, hover effects, etc...).
