# BroadwayHD

BroadwayHD is an online streaming service extending the reach of Broadway and Broadway caliber shows to anyone, anywhere.  Tilson designed, developed, and continues to maintain BroadwayHD’s subscription-based web application, delivering a wide variety of on-demand theatre productions as well as supporting frequent live streams from renowned theatres across the U.S.

A substantial user interface redesign was undertaken in late 2017 and launched just before the beginning of 2018.  The primary goals of the redesign were to provide clearer navigation, a shorter path to the BroadwayHD library of content, a modern user experience for content delivery, and to streamline the purchase-path flow for new users, increasing conversion rates and reducing bounce rates.  These goals were met through a variety of various sub-tasks undertaken by the developers at Tilson.

## New Site Design & Styling

The first major task was to work hand-in-hand with BroadwayHD's design team to come up with a new color palette, design scheme, and style-guide for the new site.  We wanted a modern, minimalistic style that allowed for the user to focus on the content of the platform.  The re-branding effort resulted in a new logo, brighter colors, and modern platform styling (buttons, fonts, layout, sitemap).

Based on the new style-guide, Tilson revamped the web-app's architecture to include some updated style best-practices including compilation, concatenation, and minification of syntactically awesome stylesheets (better known as SASS) to better organize and maintain BroadwayHD's styles throughout the site.
